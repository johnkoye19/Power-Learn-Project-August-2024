## Out of School Children Database
According to UNESCO, the world had about [250 million](https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/250-million-children-out-school-what-you-need-know-about-unescos-latest-education-data#:~:text=New%20UNESCO%20data%20shows%20that,progress%20continues%20to%20stagnate%20globally.) out-of-school children in 2022. Unsurprisingly, the world's out-of-school children are mostly children in poor and rural areas and are [mostly girls](https://uis.unesco.org/apps/visualisations/oosci-data-tool/index-en.html#en/cover). The World Bank estimates that about [700 million](https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/poverty-prosperity-and-planet) people leave in extreme poverty. This means that around 8% of the world's population lives on less than $2.15 (US dollars) a day.

We can't overestate the rights of children to education and the detrimenttal effects on our society if our children are unable to attend quality schools. Aside from social inequality and low earnings, there is a rise in the manipulation of out-of-school children to participate in criminal activities of different scales.

It becomes imperative to do something about it. This project aims to tackle the out-of-school children situation by employing a wholistic approach to it.
